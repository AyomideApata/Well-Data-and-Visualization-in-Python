# Well-Data-and-Visualization-in-Python

Data Translate & plots for subsurface analysis - logs and facies
Creating a new dictionary and linking it with a new value. Using Seaborn (Pairplots) in data exploration.
In creating Scatter plot of LITH Colum and WELL.( NPHI vs. RHOB )

- Pandas will be used to load and store our data.
- Matplotlib will be used in visualizing the contents of the wells log data.
- Lasio is a library use to work with well data in Python. 
- Welly is another package that helps us manipulate well data. It provides lots of user-friendly visuals for well header and curve data and simplifies some quick plotting too.
- Seaborn library use in creating data exploration visuals, particularly for analysis of multi-dimensional datasets like wells. Like how the relationship between NHPI and RHOB varies across each lithofacies
